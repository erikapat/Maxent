Here present an application developed in Shinny to calculate densities using Maximum Entropy Methods. 
We use Maxentropic Methods of the paper the paper: 
Gomes-Gonçalves, e.t al. Two maxentropic approaches to determine the probability density of compound risk losses." 
Insurance: Mathematics and Economics 62: 42-53.


Further work would include the methods of the paper: Gomes-Gonçalves, Erika, Henryk Gzyl, and Silvia Mayoral. "Density reconstructions with errors in the data." Entropy 16.6 (2014): 3257-3272.
